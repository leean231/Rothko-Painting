# Rothko-Style Rectangular Art with HTML and CSS

Create your own Rothko-inspired rectangular art pieces using HTML and CSS. Leverage the Box Model to manipulate spacing and borders for a visually appealing composition.

## The Box Model

In web development, every HTML element is treated as a box with its own spacing and border. This concept is known as the Box Model.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to create your own Rothko-style art:

1. **Set Up Your HTML File**: Create an HTML file and define the structure of your art piece using div elements.

2. **Style with CSS**: Create a separate CSS file to style your art pieces. Utilize the Box Model properties such as margin, padding, and border to achieve the desired effect.

3. **Customize Your Art**: Duplicate and modify the div elements to create multiple art pieces. Adjust the size, colors, and spacing to achieve your desired Rothko-style composition.

Feel free to experiment with different colors and sizes to create a unique Rothko-inspired masterpiece!
